2008-11-06 / v1.3.2 / Phantom Inker (inker2576@yahoo.com)
	* Added regression tests for parsing equal signs in tags per tracker
		ID #2220598.

2008-08-08 / v1.3.1 RELEASE / Phantom Inker (inker2576@yahoo.com)
	* Added profiler class and profiling code.
	* Added support for removable sections in compressed version.
	* Removed major performance bottleneck in Internal_ProcessSmileys()
		that cut overall parsing times to about one third of what they
		were before.
	* Added PHP 4 compatiblity check for str_split; fixes a significant
		bug on PHP 4 systems.
	* Simplified test script's time output, since the new profiling code can
		track it more accurately when debugging.

2008-08-07 / v1.3 RELEASE / Phantom Inker (inker2576@yahoo.com)
	* Exposed the functionality of FillTemplate() as a public function.
	* Changed template-filling to have its default encoding be RAW, not
		HTMLEncode().  This will affect any ENHANCED rule used with v1.2
		or earlier; those rules MUST be converted to use the new /e
		flag or they will not function properly.
	* Changed 'plain_link' processing to use FillTemplate().
	* Added URL/domain-name/email-address auto-detection (turned off by default).
	* Added conformance tests for URL/etc. auto-detection.
	* Added URL/etc. auto-detection APIs to documentation.
	* Added 'k' flag and '.' operator to FillTemplate().
	* Added FillTemplate() API to documentation.
	* Added FillTemplate() example.
	* Changed example programs to use "nbbc.php", not "src/nbbc_main.php".
	* Added RSS example to demonstrate limiting and plain modes.
	* Changed full example to offer checkboxes for testing various modes.
	* Added an appendix containing sample CSS.
	* Added usage sections to the documentation for limited-length mode,
		plain-HTML mode, and URL-autodetection mode.
	* Added new NBBC logo :-)

	   the URL as content instead of in the tag itself.

	* Fixed incorrect rule declaration logic for callback functions.
	* Fixed section-link glitch in user's manual.
	* Fixed bug that was prohibiting uncompressed version from working right.
	* Removed (currently) unused BBCODE_OUTPUT_TEXT declarations (these probably

	* Added short table-of-contents to user's manual for web site.
	* Added five example scripts to the new examples/ directory.
